# personal-portfolio
Evidence of my personal projects related to Data Science, and some experimental models for weather forecasting. 


My principles: 
I. Remember that this portfolio has to be:
  1. Fun: Original, dynamic, as well as related to what I love and aspire to be.
  2. Technical: Relevant to the domain of data science and -for a company- technologies that are in their stack (e.g., Azure, Apache).
  3. Explainable: Get leverage of metadata, and justify the reasons I chose a certain architecture, flow, and libraries instead of another.
     

II. Suggestions to develop a project:
  1. Choose a project that leverages some prior knowledge within my field as a scientist and as a d-a-t-a scientist.
  2. Propose a solid research question that can be answered numerically, and be explained further qualitatively.
  3. Search for raw data and wrangle it.

Once it is done discuss other options for each election made (e.g., model choice, data validation process, discussion on model outputs and metrics responding to whether they are pertinent or effective to anwer questions, alternative approaches to answer the question).

III. When sharing the portfolio:
  1. What I build?
  2. Why did I build it?
e.g., I made a forecasting model to plan my hike to Acatenango.
